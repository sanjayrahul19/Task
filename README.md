# Movie App

This is a React application that allows users to view a list of movies, add/remove movies from their favorites, and persist their favorites in `localStorage`. The app also includes user login and sign-up functionality.

## Features

- **Movie List**: Fetches and displays a list of movies from an external API.
- **Favorites**: Allows users to add or remove movies from their favorites list.
- **User Authentication**: Supports user login and sign-up.
- **Persistent Data**: The favorites list is stored in `localStorage`, so it persists even after the user refreshes the page.
- **API Used**: [Free Test API](https://freetestapi.com/api/v1/movies) to fetch movie data.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **localStorage**: To store the list of favorite movies locally on the user's browser.
- **React Hooks**: For managing state and side effects in function components.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation between pages (login, sign-up, and movie list).
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to fetch movie data.
